Thanks for your interest in improving AutoKPI Telemetry!

## How to contribute

- **Fork** the repo and create a branch from `main`.
- Open an **issue** first for substantial changes (new metrics, file formats, etc.).
- Submit a **pull request** with a clear description and minimal, focused commits.
- Please include tests or sample data cases whenever possible.

## Coding style

- Keep scripts **simple, explicit, and dependency-light** (pandas/numpy only).
- Add **docstrings** and **usage examples** to each script.
- For metrics: update `docs/METRICS.md`.
